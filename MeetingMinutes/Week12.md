# Week 12 Meeting Minutes - 12/08/2022
## Participants: Joseph Cameron (Me), Ian Miguel, Kenneth Boyd, Xu Zhu

This meeting was primarily focused on details of the evaluation and conclusion chapters of the dissertation. I also asked questions on the dissertation's formatting and appendix formatting etc.

As the dissertation hand-in is on 16/08/2022, this was the last of the dissertation project's weekly meetings. So, I thanked Ian, Ken, & Xu for their superb supervision throughout the project, and confirmed that I would finish the evaluation and conclusion chapters within the next few days to allow time for everyone to provide feedback on those chapters. This would also allow time for final checks on the whole dissertation during the final days before handing it in on 16/08/2022.
