# Week 10 Status Report

This week I have been undertaking the evaluation study with the five recruited participants, and I have finished gathering all the qualitative and quantitative data. Now, I have started using the same grounded theory approach to perform qualitative data analysis like before in the user requirements study.

With the 16/08/2022 deadline fast approaching, I have also been writing the design and implementation chapters with the aim of providing a draft in the next meeting.
