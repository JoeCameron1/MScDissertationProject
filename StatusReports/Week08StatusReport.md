# Week 8 Status Report

This week I have managed to almost finish the editor mode of the Novel MIDI controller and I uploaded a close-to-finished working prototype of the Novel MIDI controller application to the module management system.

Moreover, I have made progress on writing an initial draft of my the design chapter for the dissertation.

Another thing to mention is that I have notified all recruited participants that the evaluation study will take place within the next 10 days or so. This should give plenty of time to organise meetings for the study.
