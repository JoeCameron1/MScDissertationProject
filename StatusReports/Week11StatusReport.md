# Week 11 Status Report

This week, I finished writing the Introduction, Literature Review, User Requirements Study, Design, and Implementation chapters of my dissertation. Thank you Ian, Ken, & Xu for the constructive feedback throughout the week.

I also managed to finish both the qualitative and quantitative data analysis for the evaluation study, so I am now ready to write my evaluation and conclusion chapters.
