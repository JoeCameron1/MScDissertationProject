# Week 1 Status Report

During the past week following from our first meeting, I have gathered much background knowledge on the MIDI protocol and how I could start thinking about implementing a MIDI controller that uses touch-free interactions through the Leap Motion controller.
As a result, I have figured out that I can use Java to effectively make a plugin that can communicate to something like Logic Pro.
I haven’t yet implemented this officially, but it should work in the same fashion as connecting a MIDI keyboard.
In straightforward terms, I would essentially use the Leap Motion controller to send the same information that would otherwise be sent by a traditional MIDI keyboard.
 
An afternoon was spent reading all the resources that both Ian and Ken sent through from the previous meeting.
I was researching the Max software suggested by Ian, and it could certainly still be used in my project for the editor/controller I make and for user studies etc.
Max seems to be far better suited towards controlling MIDI effects, whereas a DAW like Logic is far better for composing in MIDI in my opinion, so for this project I foresee Logic being my first preference if everything goes smoothly.
 
Importantly, I have spent most of my time this week figuring out some clear objectives for the project, which I have uploaded to our team on Microsoft Teams.
 
I also felt it was crucial to start thinking about the structure of my dissertation project at this early stage, so I ideated through that for some time.
I have uploaded my initial plan for the structure of the dissertation report on our team on Microsoft Teams also.
 
Finally, I also set up some organisational tools for this project.
I created a Git repository hosted on GitHub to store the project’s code and notes/logs and additionally, I set up a team for us on Microsoft Teams which could be handy to share files between the three of us.
It occurred to me that for organising references, I will need to use an application such as Zotero to keep track of everything.
I aim to write my report in LaTeX and Zotero has good features for use in a LaTeX environment.
