# Week 9 Status Report

Over the past week I managed to complete the implementation phase of the project! I managed to finish the Novel MIDI Controller application and both its live and editor modes. The application and all its features/user interactions are ready to be tested with participants in the upcoming evaluation study.

Furthermore, I have also completed an initial version of the researcher script for the evaluation study. I have scripts for the observation study, semi-structured interview, and the questionnaire. I look forward to both discussing this script tomorrow and also showing everyone the full Novel MIDI controller application.
